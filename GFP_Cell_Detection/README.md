# Matalab Code for Updated GFP cell detection
`main_bam.m` is the main script which calls the two sub-processes phase-1 and phase-2 for cell detection.
The directory containing all the sections of a brain is fed as input and the cell centers detected by the algorithm is the corresponding output obtained.
To run this code on Elzar, use `run_script.sh` with minimum 64GB of memory.
